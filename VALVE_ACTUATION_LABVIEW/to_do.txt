to do:
add fluigent control with feedback of current pressure readout
sequential control of valve: (1, 2, 3, 4):inlet, (5, 6, 7, 8): outlet
	-eg: valve_1(on)
		delay(some amount of time)
		valve_5(on)
	-reset: (1, 2, 3, 4) [(53, 11), (52, 3), (51, 4), (50, 5)]- pressurized
			(5, 6, 7, 8) [(49, 6), (48, 7), (47,8), (46, 9)]- depressurized
